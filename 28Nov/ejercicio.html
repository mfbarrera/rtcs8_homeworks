          it is a known fact that the right styleguide can significantly
          increase development speed, debugging, and the implementation of new
          features in legacy code. Sadly, most CSS codebases are sometimes
          developed without any structure or naming conventions. This leads to
          an unmaintainable CSS codebase in the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the
          development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the
          same language. Using proper naming will prepare you for the changes in
          design of the website.

          Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. While
          blocks can be nested and interact with each other, semantically they
          remain equal; there is no precedence or hierarchy. Holistic entities
          without DOM representation (such as controllers or models) can be
          blocks as well.

          Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. Any element is
          semantically tied to its block.

          Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior
          or state.
